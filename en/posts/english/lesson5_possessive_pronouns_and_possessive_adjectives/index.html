To understand how possessive pronouns can make things simpler and clearer, first take a look at this example of a sentence that does not use a possessive pronoun:\nRaúl’s peace lilies were healthier than my peace lilies.\nIt sounds repetitive and feels a little unnecessary to state “peace lilies” twice in this sentence.\nRewriting with a possessive pronoun simplifies things:\nRaúl’s peace lilies were healthier than mine.\nPossessive pronoun examples My phone is dead. Pass me *yours*.\nDid you know that Labrador is *mine*?\nThe house on the corner is *theirs*.\nAs you can see, it is common to see independent possessive pronouns at the ends of clauses or phrases.\nPossessive adjectives Possessive adjectives also clarify who or what owns something.\nUnlike possessive pronouns—which replace nouns—possessive adjectives go before nouns to modify them.\nLike independent possessive pronouns, possessive adjectives can help streamline sentences.\nTo see what we mean, take a look at a sentence that does not have any possessive adjectives—and sounds a little clunky as a result:\nJane takes pride in Jane’s outfits.\nIt sounds odd to use Jane’s name twice in this sentence. A possessive adjective modifying the noun outfits solves the problem:\nJane takes pride in her outfits.\nThus, possessive adjectives are quite handy and are used frequently in the English language.\nPossessive adjective examples *My* plane is delayed.\n*Your* dinner is ready.\nCould you bring *his* tea out to him?\nRemember not to judge a book by *its* cover.\nI would have knocked on *their* door, but I heard *their* baby crying.\nA common mistake: its vs. it’s A common mistake is putting an apostrophe in the possessive adjective its.\nIt is easy to confuse its with the contraction of it is, it’s, which does have an apostrophe.\nRemember, though, possessive adjectives never use apostrophes.\n❌Incorrect: The boat lost it’s mast in the storm.\n✅Correct: The boat lost its mast in the storm.\n❌Incorrect: Don’t judge a book by it’s cover.\n✅Correct: Don’t judge a book by its cover.\n",

        <div class="post-content"><p>As their names imply, both possessive adjectives and possessive pronouns show ownership.</p>
<p>The independent possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, and theirs.</p>
<p>The possessive adjectives, also called possessive determiners, are my, our, your, his, her, its, and their.</p>
<p>We break down each type and offer examples of their usage below.</p>
<h1 id="independent-possessive-pronouns">Independent possessive pronouns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#independent-possessive-pronouns">#</a></h1>
<p>Possessive pronouns are a type of possessive noun.</p>
<p>Also called absolute possessive pronouns, possessive pronouns simplify constructions that show possession of a noun by replacing it—in other words, independent possessive pronouns must stand alone and be used without a noun. To understand how possessive pronouns can make things simpler and clearer, first take a look at this example of a sentence that does not use a possessive pronoun:</p>
<p><code>Raúl’s peace lilies were healthier than my peace lilies.</code></p>
<p>It sounds repetitive and feels a little unnecessary to state “peace lilies” twice in this sentence.</p>
<p>Rewriting with a possessive pronoun simplifies things:</p>
<p><code>Raúl’s peace lilies were healthier than mine.</code></p>
<h2 id="possessive-pronoun-examples">Possessive pronoun examples<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#possessive-pronoun-examples">#</a></h2>
<p><code>My phone is dead. Pass me *yours*.</code></p>
<p><code>Did you know that Labrador is *mine*?</code></p>
<p><code>The house on the corner is *theirs*.</code></p>
<p>As you can see, it is common to see independent possessive pronouns at the ends of clauses or phrases.</p>
<h1 id="possessive-adjectives">Possessive adjectives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#possessive-adjectives">#</a></h1>
<p>Possessive adjectives also clarify who or what owns something.</p>
<p>Unlike possessive pronouns—which replace nouns—possessive adjectives go before nouns to modify them.</p>
<p>Like independent possessive pronouns, possessive adjectives can help streamline sentences.</p>
<p>To see what we mean, take a look at a sentence that does not have any possessive adjectives—and sounds a little clunky as a result:</p>
<p><code>Jane takes pride in Jane’s outfits.</code></p>
<p>It sounds odd to use Jane’s name twice in this sentence. A possessive adjective modifying the noun outfits solves the problem:</p>
<p><code>Jane takes pride in her outfits.</code></p>
<p>Thus, possessive adjectives are quite handy and are used frequently in the English language.</p>
<h2 id="possessive-adjective-examples">Possessive adjective examples<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#possessive-adjective-examples">#</a></h2>
<p><code>*My* plane is delayed.</code></p>
<p><code>*Your* dinner is ready.</code></p>
<p><code>Could you bring *his* tea out to him?</code></p>
<p><code>Remember not to judge a book by *its* cover.</code></p>
<p><code>I would have knocked on *their* door, but I heard *their* baby crying.</code></p>
<h2 id="a-common-mistake-its-vs-its">A common mistake: its vs. it’s<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-common-mistake-its-vs-its">#</a></h2>
<p>A common mistake is putting an apostrophe in the possessive adjective its.</p>
<p>It is easy to confuse its with the contraction of it is, it’s, which does have an apostrophe.</p>
<p>Remember, though, possessive adjectives never use apostrophes.</p>
<p>❌Incorrect: <code>The boat lost it’s mast in the storm.</code></p>
<p>✅Correct: <code>The boat lost its mast in the storm.</code></p>
<p>❌Incorrect: <code>Don’t judge a book by it’s cover.</code></p>
<p>✅Correct: <code>Don’t judge a book by its cover.</code></p>
