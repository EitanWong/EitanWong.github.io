  "articleBody": "What Is a Noun? Definition, Types, and Examples Nouns are everywhere in our writing. But what are all the types of nouns you come across, and how do you use them?\nA noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. In a sentence, nouns can play the role of subject, direct object, indirect object, subject complement, object complement, appositive, or modifier.\nSome noun examples include:\ncat bicycle Taylor Swift Kuala Lumpur Types of nouns Nouns form a large proportion of English vocabulary, and they come in a wide variety of types.\nNouns can name a person: Albert Einstein\nthe president\nmy mother\na girl\nNouns can name a place: Mount Vesuvius\nDisneyland\nmy bedroom\nNouns can name things: Things might include intangible things, such as concepts, activities, or processes. Some might even be hypothetical or imaginary things.\nshoe\nfaucet\nfreedom\nThe Elder Wand\nbasketball\nProper nouns vs. common nouns One important distinction to be made is whether a noun is a proper noun or a common noun. A proper noun is a specific name of a person, place, or thing and is always capitalized.\nDoes Tina have much homework to do this evening?\nTina is the name of a specific person.\nI would like to visit Old Faithful.\nOld Faithful is the specific name of a geological phenomenon.\nThe opposite of a proper noun is a common noun, sometimes known as a generic noun. A common noun is the generic name of an item in a class or group and is not capitalized unless appearing at the beginning of a sentence or in a title.\nThe girl crossed the river.\nGirl is a common noun; we do not learn the identity of the girl by reading this sentence, though we know the action she takes. River is also a common noun in this sentence.\nTypes of common nouns Common or generic nouns can be broken down into three subtypes: concrete nouns, abstract nouns, and collective nouns. A concrete noun is something that is perceived by the senses; something that is physical or real.\nI heard the doorbell.\nMy keyboard is sticky.\nDoorbell and keyboard name real things that can be sensed.\nConversely, an abstract noun is something that cannot be perceived by the senses.\nWe can‚Äôt imagine the courage it took to do that.\nCourage is an abstract noun. Courage can‚Äôt be seen, heard, or sensed in any other way, but we know it exists.\nA collective noun denotes a group or collection of people or things.\nThat pack of lies is disgraceful.\nPack as used here is a collective noun. Collective nouns take a singular verb, as they refer to the collection of people or things they identify as one entity‚Äîin this case, the singular verb is.\nA pride of lions roamed the savanna.\nPride is also a collective noun.\nNouns and number All nouns are either singular or plural in number. A singular noun refers to one person, place, thing, or idea and requires a singular verb, while a plural noun refers to more than one person, place, thing, or idea and requires a plural verb.\nForming plural nouns Many English plural nouns can be formed by adding -s or -es to the singular form, although there are also many exceptions.\ncat‚Üícats\nThese two cats are both black.\nNote the plural verb are.\ntax‚Üítaxes\nhouse‚Üíhouses\nCountable nouns vs. uncountable nouns Concrete and abstract common nouns can be further classified as either countable or uncountable. Countable nouns are nouns that can be counted, even if the resulting number would be extraordinarily high (like the number of humans in the world). Countable nouns can be singular or plural and can be used with numbers and modifiers like a/an, the, some, any, a few, and many.\nHere is a cat.\nHere are a few cats.\nHere are eight cats.\nUncountable nouns, or mass nouns, are nouns that are impossible to count, whether because they name intangible concepts (e.g., information, animal husbandry, wealth), collections of things that are considered as wholes (e.g., jewelry, equipment, the working class), or homogeneous physical substances (e.g., milk, sand, air). Although most of these nouns are singular in form, because they refer to things that can‚Äôt be isolated and counted on their own, they are never used with the singular indefinite article a or an. Singular concrete uncountable nouns can often be expressed in countable units by adding a countable noun like piece (with of). On their own, uncountable nouns can be modified by the definite article, the, or indefinite adjectives like some.\nThey‚Äôd love to rent some property around here.\nThey‚Äôd love to rent a piece of property around here.\nStudents don‚Äôt seem to have much homework these days.\nCould you help me move the furniture into the other room?\nNouns and the possessive case The possessive case shows the relationship of a noun to other words in a sentence. That relationship can be ownership, possession, occupancy, a personal relationship, or another kind of association. The possessive of a singular noun is formed by adding an apostrophe and the letter s.\nThe cat‚Äôs toy was missing.\nThe cat possesses the toy, and we denote this by use of -‚Äôs at the end of cat.\nCasey‚Äôs sister is a geologist.\nHere, the possessive case indicates the relationship between Casey and their sister.\nThe novel‚Äôs release made quite a splash.\nIn the above example, the possessive case is denoting that novel is in the role of object in relationship to release; someone released the novel.\nThe possessive of a plural noun that ends in ‚Äìs or ‚Äìes is formed by adding just an apostrophe.\nMy nieces‚Äô prom outfits were exquisite.\nThe possessive of an irregular plural noun is formed by adding ‚Äì‚Äôs.\nThe children‚Äôs drawings were hung on the walls.\nWhen a singular noun ends in the letter s or z, the general rule of adding ‚Äì‚Äôs often applies.\nI have been invited to my boss‚Äôs house for dinner.\nMs. Sanchez‚Äôs coat is still hanging on the back of her chair.\nThis is a matter of a style, however, and some style guides call for leaving off the s after the apostrophe.\nBrussels‚Äô cathedrals attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.\nWhichever style an organization or writer chooses should be used consistently.\nFunctions of nouns\nNouns take on different roles based on their relationships to the rest of the words in a sentence.\nNouns as subjects Every sentence must have a subject, and that subject will always be a noun or pronoun. The subject of a sentence is the person, place, or thing that is doing or being or experiencing whatever is described by the verb of the sentence.\nMaria played the piece beautifully.\nThe noun Maria is the subject of this sentence; it tells us who is performing the action described by the sentence‚Äôs verb (played).\nNouns as objects Nouns can also be objects of a transitive verb in a sentence. An object can be either a direct object (a noun that receives the action described by the verb) or an indirect object (a noun that receives direct object).\nCleo passed the salt.\nCleo passed Otto the salt.\nIn both of the above sentences, the noun salt is the direct object of the verb passed; the salt is what Cleo passed. In the second sentence, there is also an indirect object: the noun Otto. Otto is the person to whom Cleo passed the salt; Otto is the recipient of the salt. A good way to identify an indirect object in a sentence is to ask yourself to whom/what or for whom/what something is being done.\nNouns as subject and object complements Another role nouns sometimes perform in a sentence is that of a subject complement. A subject complement normally follows a linking verb such as be, become, or seem and gives more information about the subject of the sentence.\nMary is a teacher.\nIn this sentence, the noun teacher is being used as a subject complement. A teacher is what Mary is.\nA related function of nouns is to act as an object complement, which provides more information about the direct object of a sentence with a transitive verb.\nI now pronounce you husbands.\nHusbands is a noun used as an object complement in this sentence. Verbs that denote making, naming, or creating are often followed by nouns behaving as object complements.\nNouns as appositives A noun used as an appositive immediately follows another noun in order to further define or identify it. You can also say that the second noun is in apposition to the first noun.\nMy brother, Michael, is six years old.\nMichael is an appositive here, further identifying the noun phrase my brother. Appositives can be restrictive or nonrestrictive; in the above example, we can see from the fact that it is set off between commas that Michael is nonrestrictive‚Äîthat is, it could be left out of the sentence without leaving out essential information about who is six years old. In other words, we can surmise that Michael is the writer‚Äôs only brother; telling us his name is extra information about him. Here is a version of the same sentence where the appositive is used restrictively, without being set off by commas:\nMy brother Michael is six years old.\nIn this case, the appositive Michael is providing information that is essential for narrowing down which brother the writer is telling us about. We can infer that they have multiple brothers, and understand that it is the one named Michael who is six years old.\nNouns as modifiers Sometimes, nouns can be used to modify other nouns, functioning like adjectives. When they do this, they are often called attributive nouns. .\nHe is a speed demon.\nSpeed is normally a noun, but here it is acting as an adjective to modify demon.\nNoun FAQs What are nouns? Nouns refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. They serve as the subjects, direct objects, and indirect objects in a sentence, along with other roles.\nWhat are some examples of nouns? Nouns can be living things (Keanu Reeves or cat), places (beach or Detroit), things (ruler or PlayStation 5), or ideas (nihilism or the theory of evolution).\nWhat are the different types of nouns? Common nouns refer to general things (like parks), and proper nouns refer to a specific thing (like Yellowstone National Park). Nouns can also be plural or singular, depending on how many there are, countable or uncountable, and possessive or not possessive.\nHow do you identify a noun in a sentence? Nouns often have articles (the, a, or an) before them in a sentence, but not always. Sometimes you‚Äôll see adjectives like red or some before nouns. Aside from the first word in a sentence, if a word is capitalized, then it‚Äôs most likely a proper noun, such as a person‚Äôs name.\n",

<p>Nouns are everywhere in our writing. But what are all the types of nouns you come across, and how do you use them?</p>
<p>A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. In a sentence, nouns can play the role of <strong>subject</strong>, <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/direct-object/"><strong>direct object</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/indirect-object/"><strong>indirect object</strong></a>, <strong>subject complement</strong>, <strong>object complement</strong>, <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/appositive/"><strong>appositive</strong></a>, or <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/modifiers/"><strong>modifier</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Some noun examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>cat</em></li>
<li><em>bicycle</em></li>
<li><em>Taylor Swift</em></li>
<li><em>Kuala Lumpur</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-nouns">Types of nouns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#types-of-nouns">#</a></h2>
<p>Nouns form a large proportion of English vocabulary, and they come in a wide variety of types.</p>
<h3 id="nouns-can-name-a-person">Nouns can name a person:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-can-name-a-person">#</a></h3>
<p><strong><em>Albert Einstein</em></strong></p>
<p><em>the</em> <strong><em>president</em></strong></p>
<p><em>my</em> <strong><em>mother</em></strong></p>
<p><em>a</em> <strong><em>girl</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="nouns-can-name-a-place">Nouns can name a place:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-can-name-a-place">#</a></h3>
<p><strong><em>Mount Vesuvius</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Disneyland</em></strong></p>
<p><em>my</em> <strong><em>bedroom</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="nouns-can-name-things">Nouns can name things:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-can-name-things">#</a></h3>
<p>Things might include intangible things, such as concepts, activities, or processes. Some might even be hypothetical or imaginary things.</p>
<p><strong><em>shoe</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>faucet</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>freedom</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The</em> <strong><em>Elder Wand</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>basketball</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="proper-nouns-vs-common-nouns">Proper nouns vs. common nouns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#proper-nouns-vs-common-nouns">#</a></h3>
<p>One important distinction to be made is whether a noun is a <strong>proper noun</strong> or a <strong>common noun</strong>. A proper noun is a specific name of a person, place, or thing and is always capitalized.</p>
<p><em>Does</em> <strong><em>Tina</em></strong> <em>have much homework to do this evening?</em></p>
<p><em>Tina</em> is the name of a specific person.</p>
<p><em>I would like to visit</em> <strong><em>Old Faithful.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Old Faithful</em> is the specific name of a geological phenomenon.</p>
<p>The opposite of a proper noun is a common noun, sometimes known as a generic noun. A common noun is the generic name of an item in a class or group and is not capitalized unless appearing at the beginning of a sentence or in a title.</p>
<p><em>The</em> <strong><em>girl</em></strong> <em>crossed the</em> <strong><em>river</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Girl</em> is a common noun; we do not learn the identity of the girl by reading this sentence, though we know the action she takes. <em>River</em> is also a common noun in this sentence.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-common-nouns">Types of common nouns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#types-of-common-nouns">#</a></h2>
<p>Common or generic nouns can be broken down into three subtypes: <strong>concrete nouns</strong>, <strong>abstract nouns</strong>, and <strong>collective nouns</strong>. A concrete noun is something that is perceived by the senses; something that is physical or real.</p>
<p><em>I heard the</em> <strong><em>doorbell</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>My</em> <strong><em>keyboard</em></strong> <em>is sticky.</em></p>
<p><em>Doorbell</em> and <em>keyboard</em> name real things that can be sensed.</p>
<p>Conversely, an abstract noun is something that cannot be perceived by the senses.</p>
<p><em>We can‚Äôt imagine the</em> <strong><em>courage</em></strong> <em>it took to do that.</em></p>
<p><em>Courage</em> is an abstract noun. Courage can‚Äôt be seen, heard, or sensed in any other way, but we know it exists.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/collective-nouns/">collective noun</a> denotes a group or collection of people or things.</p>
<p><em>That</em> <strong><em>pack</em></strong> <em>of lies is disgraceful.</em></p>
<p><em>Pack</em> as used here is a collective noun. Collective nouns take a singular verb, as they refer to the collection of people or things they identify as one entity‚Äîin this case, the singular verb <em>is</em>.</p>
<p><em>A</em> <strong><em>pride</em></strong> <em>of lions roamed the savanna.</em></p>
<p><em>Pride</em> is also a collective noun.</p>
<h2 id="nouns-and-number">Nouns and number<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-and-number">#</a></h2>
<p>All nouns are either singular or plural in number. A singular noun refers to one person, place, thing, or idea and requires a singular verb, while a plural noun refers to more than one person, place, thing, or idea and requires a plural verb.</p>
<h3 id="forming-plural-nouns">Forming plural nouns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#forming-plural-nouns">#</a></h3>
<p>Many English <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/plural-nouns/">plural nouns</a> can be formed by adding <em>-s</em> or <em>-es</em> to the singular form, although there are also many exceptions.</p>
<p><em>cat‚Üícats</em></p>
<p><em>These two</em> <strong><em>cats</em></strong> <em>are both black.</em></p>
<p>Note the plural verb <em>are</em>.</p>
<p><em>tax‚Üítaxes</em></p>
<p><em>house‚Üíhouses</em></p>
<h3 id="countable-nouns-vs-uncountable-nouns">Countable nouns vs. uncountable nouns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#countable-nouns-vs-uncountable-nouns">#</a></h3>
<p>Concrete and abstract common nouns can be further classified as either countable or uncountable. Countable nouns are nouns that can be counted, even if the resulting number would be extraordinarily high (like the number of humans in the world). Countable nouns can be singular or plural and can be used with numbers and modifiers like <em>a/an</em>, <em>the</em>, <em>some</em>, <em>any</em>, <em>a few</em>, and <em>many</em>.</p>
<p><em>Here is</em> <strong><em>a</em></strong> <strong><em>cat</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are</em> <strong><em>a few</em></strong> <strong><em>cats</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are</em> <strong><em>eight</em></strong> <strong><em>cats</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>Uncountable nouns, or <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/mass-noun/">mass nouns</a>, are nouns that are impossible to count, whether because they name intangible concepts (e.g., <em>information</em>, <em>animal husbandry</em>, <em>wealth</em>), collections of things that are considered as wholes (e.g., <em>jewelry</em>, <em>equipment</em>, the <em>working class</em>), or homogeneous physical substances (e.g., <em>milk</em>, <em>sand</em>, <em>air</em>). Although most of these nouns are singular in form, because they refer to things that can‚Äôt be isolated and counted on their own, they are never used with the singular indefinite article <em>a</em> or <em>an</em>. Singular concrete uncountable nouns can often be expressed in countable units by adding a countable noun like <em>piece</em> (with <em>of</em>). On their own, uncountable nouns can be modified by the definite article, <em>the</em>, or indefinite adjectives like <em>some</em>.</p>
<p><em>They‚Äôd love to rent</em> <strong><em>some</em></strong> <strong><em>property</em></strong> <em>around here.</em></p>
<p><em>They‚Äôd love to rent</em> <strong><em>a piece of property</em></strong> <em>around here.</em></p>
<p><em>Students don‚Äôt seem to have</em> <strong><em>much</em></strong> <strong><em>homework</em></strong> <em>these days.</em></p>

<h2 id="nouns-and-the-possessive-case">Nouns and the possessive case<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-and-the-possessive-case">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/possessive-case/">possessive case</a> shows the relationship of a noun to other words in a sentence. That relationship can be ownership, possession, occupancy, a personal relationship, or another kind of association. The possessive of a singular noun is formed by adding an <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/apostrophe/">apostrophe and the letter <em>s</em>.</a></p>
<p><em>The</em> <strong><em>cat‚Äôs toy</em></strong> <em>was missing.</em></p>
<p>The cat possesses the toy, and we denote this by use of -‚Äô<em>s</em> at the end of <em>cat</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Casey‚Äôs sister</em></strong> <em>is a geologist.</em></p>
<p>Here, the possessive case indicates the relationship between Casey and their sister.</p>
<p><em>The</em> <strong><em>novel‚Äôs release</em></strong> <em>made quite a splash.</em></p>
<p>In the above example, the possessive case is denoting that <em>novel</em> is in the role of object in relationship to <em>release</em>; someone released the novel.</p>
<p>The possessive of a plural noun that ends in ‚Äì<em>s</em> or ‚Äì<em>es</em> is formed by adding just an apostrophe.</p>
<p><em>My</em> <strong><em>nieces‚Äô</em></strong> <em>prom outfits were exquisite.</em></p>
<p>The possessive of an irregular plural noun is formed by adding ‚Äì<em>‚Äôs</em>.</p>
<p><em>The</em> <strong><em>children‚Äôs</em></strong> <em>drawings were hung on the walls.</em></p>
<p>When a singular noun ends in the letter <em>s</em> or <em>z</em>, the general rule of adding ‚Äì<em>‚Äôs</em> often applies.</p>
<p><em>I have been invited to my</em> <strong><em>boss‚Äôs</em></strong> <em>house for dinner.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Ms. Sanchez‚Äôs</em></strong> <em>coat is still hanging on the back of her chair.</em></p>
<p>This is a matter of a style, however, and some <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/style-guide/">style guides</a> call for leaving off the <em>s</em> after the apostrophe.</p>
<p><strong><em>Brussels‚Äô</em></strong> <em>cathedrals attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.</em></p>
<p>Whichever style an organization or writer chooses should be used consistently.</p>
<p>Functions of nouns</p>
<p>Nouns take on different roles based on their relationships to the rest of the words in a sentence.</p>
<h3 id="nouns-as-subjects">Nouns as subjects<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-as-subjects">#</a></h3>
<p>Every sentence must have a <strong>subject</strong>, and that subject will always be a noun or <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/pronouns/">pronoun</a>. The subject of a sentence is the person, place, or thing that is doing or being or experiencing whatever is described by the <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/verbs/">verb</a> of the sentence.</p>
<p><strong><em>Maria</em></strong> <em>played the piece beautifully.</em></p>
<p>The noun <em>Maria</em> is the subject of this sentence; it tells us who is performing the action described by the sentence‚Äôs verb (<em>played</em>).</p>
<h3 id="nouns-as-objects">Nouns as objects<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-as-objects">#</a></h3>
<p>Nouns can also be <strong>objects</strong> of a <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/transitive-verbs/">transitive verb</a> in a sentence. An object can be either a <strong>direct object</strong> (a noun that receives the action described by the verb) or an <strong>indirect object</strong> (a noun that receives direct object).</p>
<p><em>Cleo passed the</em> <strong><em>salt</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Cleo passed</em> <strong><em>Otto</em></strong> <em>the</em> <strong><em>salt</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>In both of the above sentences, the noun <em>salt</em> is the direct object of the verb <em>passed</em>; the salt is what Cleo passed. In the second sentence, there is also an indirect object: the noun <em>Otto</em>. Otto is the person to whom Cleo passed the salt; Otto is the recipient of the salt. A good way to identify an indirect object in a sentence is to ask yourself to whom/what or for whom/what something is being done.</p>
<h3 id="nouns-as-subject-and-object-complements">Nouns as subject and object complements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-as-subject-and-object-complements">#</a></h3>
<p>Another role nouns sometimes perform in a sentence is that of a <strong>subject complement</strong>. A subject complement normally follows a <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/linking-verbs/">linking verb</a> such as <em>be</em>, <em>become</em>, or <em>seem</em> and gives more information about the subject of the sentence.</p>
<p><em>Mary is a</em> <strong><em>teacher</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>In this sentence, the noun <em>teacher</em> is being used as a subject complement. A teacher is what Mary is.</p>
<p>A related function of nouns is to act as an <strong>object complement</strong>, which provides more information about the direct object of a sentence with a transitive verb.</p>
<p><em>I now pronounce you</em> <strong><em>husbands</em></strong>.</p>
<p><em>Husbands</em> is a noun used as an object complement in this sentence. Verbs that denote making, naming, or creating are often followed by nouns behaving as object complements.</p>
<h3 id="nouns-as-appositives">Nouns as appositives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-as-appositives">#</a></h3>
<p>A noun used as an <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/appositive/"><strong>appositive</strong></a> immediately follows another noun in order to further define or identify it. You can also say that the second noun is in apposition to the first noun.</p>
<p><em>My brother,</em> <strong><em>Michael</em></strong><em>, is six years old.</em></p>
<p><em>Michael</em> is an appositive here, further identifying the noun phrase <em>my</em> <em>brother</em>. Appositives can be <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/using-that-and-which-is-all-about-restrictive-and-non-restrictive-clauses/#:~:text=A%20nonrestrictive%20clause%2C%20on%20the,extra%20polished%20wherever%20you%20write."><strong>restrictive or</strong> <strong>nonrestrictive</strong></a>; in the above example, we can see from the fact that it is set off between commas that <em>Michael</em> is nonrestrictive‚Äîthat is, it could be left out of the sentence without leaving out essential information about who is six years old. In other words, we can surmise that Michael is the writer‚Äôs only brother; telling us his name is extra information about him. Here is a version of the same sentence where the appositive is used restrictively, without being set off by commas:</p>
<p><em>My brother</em> <strong><em>Michael</em></strong> <em>is six years old.</em></p>
<p>In this case, the appositive <em>Michael</em> is providing information that is essential for narrowing down which brother the writer is telling us about. We can infer that they have multiple brothers, and understand that it is the one named Michael who is six years old.</p>
<h3 id="nouns-as-modifiers">Nouns as modifiers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nouns-as-modifiers">#</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, nouns can be used to modify other nouns, functioning like adjectives. When they do this, they are often called <strong>attributive nouns.</strong> .</p>
<p><em>He is a</em> <strong><em>speed</em></strong> <em>demon.</em></p>
<p><em>Speed</em> is normally a noun, but here it is acting as an adjective to modify <em>demon</em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-nouns">What are nouns?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-nouns">#</a></h3>
<p>Nouns refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. They serve as the subjects, direct objects, and indirect objects in a sentence, along with other roles.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-some-examples-of-nouns">What are some examples of nouns?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-some-examples-of-nouns">#</a></h3>
<p>Nouns can be living things (<em>Keanu Reeves</em> or <em>cat</em>), places (<em>beach</em> or <em>Detroit</em>), things (<em>ruler</em> or <em>PlayStation 5</em>), or ideas (<em>nihilism</em> or <em>the theory of evolution</em>).</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-different-types-of-nouns">What are the different types of nouns?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-the-different-types-of-nouns">#</a></h3>
<p>Common nouns refer to general things (like parks), and proper nouns refer to a specific thing (like Yellowstone National Park). Nouns can also be plural or singular, depending on how many there are, countable or uncountable, and possessive or not possessive.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-identify-a-noun-in-a-sentence">How do you identify a noun in a sentence?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-do-you-identify-a-noun-in-a-sentence">#</a></h3>
<p>Nouns often have articles (<em>the</em>, <em>a</em>, or <em>an</em>) before them in a sentence, but not always. Sometimes you‚Äôll see adjectives like <em>red</em> or some before nouns. Aside from the first word in a sentence, if a word is capitalized, then it‚Äôs most likely a proper noun, such as a person‚Äôs name.</p>
